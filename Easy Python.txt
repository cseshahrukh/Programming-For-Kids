Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types

    Section 1: Introduction to Variables
        Content: Variables store data values that can be used later. We'll explore different data types like integers, floats, and strings.

    Section 2: Working with Data
        Content: Learn how to perform basic operations with variables, like arithmetic calculations and string concatenation.

Week 2: Control Structures and Conditional Statements

Lesson 3: Introduction to Control Structures

    Section 1: Understanding Control Structures
        Content: Control structures allow us to make decisions and repeat actions. We'll explore if statements and loops.

Lesson 4: Conditional Statements

    Section 1: Using if Statements
        Content: Learn how to make decisions in your program using if statements to execute code conditionally.

    Section 2: The else and elif Statements
        Content: Extend your knowledge of conditional statements by using else and elif to cover different scenarios.

Week 3: Functions and Libraries

Lesson 5: Introduction to Functions

    Section 1: Defining and Calling Functions
        Content: Functions help us organize code into reusable blocks. Learn how to define and use functions.

Lesson 6: Working with Libraries

    Section 1: Introduction to Libraries
        Content: Libraries provide pre-built functions and tools for various tasks. We'll explore using built-in and third-party libraries.

Week 4: Data Structures and Project

Lesson 7: Lists and Dictionaries

    Section 1: Using Lists
        Content: Lists store collections of data. We'll learn about indexing, slicing, and common list operations.

    Section 2: Introduction to Dictionaries
        Content: Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. Explore how to create and manipulate dictionaries.

Lesson 8: Final Project - Interactive Quiz Game

    Section 1: Designing the Quiz Game
        Content: Apply what you've learned to create an interactive quiz game using Python. Use functions, conditional statements, and data structures to build a fun and educational project.

Note: Each section of a lesson will provide detailed explanations and examples to ensure a clear understanding of the concepts. The course aims to introduce young students to programming concepts using Python in an engaging and hands-on manner.
